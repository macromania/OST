{"name":"The Open Traffic Simulation","tagline":"","body":"The Open Trafic Simulation is a project meant to be used as an extension to advance SUMO simulation tool. It is a JAVA application that provides user friendly\r\ninterface and allows users to control some aspects of SUMO simulation easily. The reason for development is to add functionality yet to be provided in a user friendly way, by other applications like the SUMO GUI. Separate windows within the main application\r\nwindow neatly arranged and tie together all the functionality that is provided to the user.\r\n\r\nOne of the main functions provided is to allow the user to easily create various\r\ntypes of maps. These can be configured in a multitude ways (e.g. grid map with configurable grid length, spider map with configurable number of arms, and random map\r\nwith configurable number of maximum distance).\r\n\r\nOther functionality provided by Open Trafic Simulation is trafic light controller.\r\nThe trafic light controller allows the user to see the list of junctions and trafic lights,\r\nconvert any selected junction to a trafic light. Also convert a random number of junctions to trafic lights. \r\nIt provides a way to change the trafic light state while simulation is active as well. \r\nIf the user selects a junction while the simulation is running, the user will be navigated to the visualized screen to show where that junction or trafic light\r\nis located on the map via SUMO GUI. This makes it easy for the user to navigate to different trafic lights and change their state.\r\n\r\nOpen Trafic Simulation has been designed to allow adding vehicles to the map\r\n(e.g. private car, bus, taxi). This makes it easy to create complex maps, with densely\r\npopulated trafic with a specific set of trafic lights. A user can then look at how trafic ows by adjusting the states of various trafic lights, adding and removing trafic lights,\r\nas well as adding more vehicles to be simulated.\r\n\r\nOpen Trafic Simulation uses the functionality provided by the SUMO binaries and\r\nthe running simulation. It interacts with the running SUMO simulation using the a\r\nsocket connector between our software and SUMO. Thus our software is used to create\r\na more user-friendly interface for users to interact with, simpler way of creating and\r\ninteracting with a map to be used for simulation (e.g. Open street maps).\r\n","google":"UA-38207584-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
